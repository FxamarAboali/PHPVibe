Introducing PHPVibe, the ultimate video sharing CMS that goes beyond videos, offering image sharing and music (mp3, SoundCloud) sharing capabilities. We proudly present it as a comprehensive multimedia solution, serving as the ideal framework for your video, image, or music website. It's an all-in-one package you won't want to miss!

## Key Features of PHPVibe CMS:

### Seamless Video Sharing:
Handle every aspect of video management effortlessly. From video uploads to multiple qualities, ffmpeg commands for video conversion, video processing, management, and thumbnail generation - no coding required! Our CMS includes a video uploader that effortlessly sends chosen ffmpeg commands to the server for smooth video processing. After upload, the videos are automatically converted to the selected quality options as defined in the admin panel.

### YouTube Support and Import:
When it comes to content building, speed is crucial. That's why PHPVibe integrates seamlessly with YouTube. Our CMS features a powerful multi-video YouTube importer, allowing you to import videos by search, playlist, or channel and assign them to specific owners and categories.

### Automated YouTube Imports:
Keep your content fresh with minimal effort. Our admin panel includes a convenient cron section for automated tasks. This means your website can continuously import new videos at any time, without manual intervention. It's a hassle-free way to keep your site up to date!

### Image Sharing:
Tap into the immense popularity of picture sharing. With the rise of platforms like Instagram, WeHeartIt, and Pinterest, the demand for image sharing has skyrocketed. PHPVibe allows users to easily upload pictures, satisfying their desire to share visual content.

### Music Component:
Enhance your website's appeal with a dedicated music section. Our CMS provides a separate upload feature, organized playlists, and improved user interactions. We've even included a sleek waves player for a seamless music listening experience!

### Premium Accounts:
Generate revenue and offer exclusive benefits. PHPVibe enables you to create premium accounts, granting special privileges to paid users. You can monetize your platform by providing access to premium content while hiding ads for premium users. It's a win-win scenario!

You can even take advantage of our YouTube comments importer, seamlessly integrating YouTube comments and channels into your own platform.

### Intuitive Design and User Experience:
Feel right at home with MediaVibe's user-friendly interface, following the design guidelines of the new YouTube. Users will instinctively know where to find what they need, resulting in a seamless browsing experience. This familiarity is crucial in reducing your Google bounce rate.
